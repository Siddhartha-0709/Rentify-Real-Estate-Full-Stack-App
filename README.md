# Rentify Real Estate Buy and Sell

This project aims to simplify the process of finding the perfect property by offering a user-friendly interface and an extensive database of property listings. Whether you're looking for a cozy apartment, a spacious family home, or a luxurious villa, our platform provides a wide range of options with detailed descriptions, high-quality images, and essential amenities.

The frontend is built using React and styled with Tailwind CSS. It provides a user-friendly interface for buyers to browse and filter properties, view detailed information about each property, and contact sellers. Buyers can also view the sellers' profiles and their posted properties.

The backend is built using Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and Cloudinary. It provides APIs for buyers to register, login, view properties, and contact sellers. It also provides APIs for sellers to register, login, post properties, and modify their posted properties' availability.
